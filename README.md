# AngularJS-Lab-01
2018 10 31 MV: lab/tutorial based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM

## Description
This is actually a pretty good starter course in all-things-Angular, but it should be noted that: 
- AngularJS is 1st generation; 
- now Angular2,3,4,5,6 and even 7 are out there; 
- there is NO simple "upgrade"-type path from coding an app using AngularJS to that app using Angular6 (current production release)

COMPLETED tutorial up to 35:20 marker; 
NOTE: adding ("registering") a CONTROLLER DOESN'T WORK unless you downgrade to a MUCH-OLDER version of angular.min.js !!!
- current version of angular.min.js is v1.7.x; 
- only version that works with this 5-year-old tutorial is v1.2.x;
- actual version used in the tutoral is angular.min.js v1.0.6  :-|

# 2018 10 31 945p CST: 
WORKING in tutorial section on Modules, Routes & Factories; 
- ADDED code to "modularize" the current code into a MODULE and an angular.controller('SimpleController', SimplerController); statement,but 
=> CODE NO LONGER WORKS; page DOESN'T even DISPLAY anymore :-( !!!
PAUSED to discuss with teammates...

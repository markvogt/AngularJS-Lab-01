# AngularJS-Lab-01
2018 10 31 MV: lab/tutorial based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM

## Description
This is actually a pretty good starter course in all-things-Angular, but it should be noted that: 
- AngularJS is 1st generation; 
- now Angular2,3,4,5,6 and even 7 are out there; 
- there is NO simple "upgrade"-type path from coding an app using AngularJS to that app using Angular6 (current production relaase)
